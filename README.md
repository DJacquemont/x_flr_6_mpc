MPC controller to fly a rocket prototype

TODO:
- Deliverable 2.1 -> Explain from an intuitive physical / mechanical perspective, why this separation into independent subsystems is possible (Overleaf)
- Deliverable 3.1 -> Design four MPC controllers for x, y , z and roll
- Deliverable 3.2 -> (18.12.23) Extend your controllers so that they can track constant references. 
- Deliverable 4.1 -> (25.12.23) (+ 4.2 BONUS) Simulate the full nonlinear system with your four controllers from the origin as initial state.
- Deliverable 5.1 -> For the z dimension only, design an offset-free tracking controller.
- Deliverable 5.2 -> (28.12.23) Simulate the system with changing mass.
- Deliverable 6.1 -> Develop a nonlinear MPC controller for the rocket using CASADI
- Deliverable 6.2 -> (05.12.23) Simulate your NMPC controller in closed-loop with increasing values for the delay
