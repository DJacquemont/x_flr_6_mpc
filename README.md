MPC controller to fly a rocket prototype

- Deliverable 2.1 -> Explain from an intuitive physical / mechanical perspective, why this separation into independent subsystems is possible
- Deliverable 3.1 -> Design four MPC controllers for x, y , z and roll
- Deliverable 3.2 -> Extend your controllers so that they can track constant references. 
- Deliverable 4.1 -> Simulate the full nonlinear system with your four controllers from the origin as initial state, add soft constraints
- Deliverable 5.1 -> For the z dimension only, design an offset-free tracking controller.
- Deliverable 5.2 -> Simulate the system with changing mass.
- Deliverable 6.1 -> Develop a nonlinear MPC controller for the rocket using CASADI
- Deliverable 6.2 -> Simulate your NMPC controller in closed-loop with increasing values for the delay
