# X-FLR-6-MPC

This project focuses on the implementation and analysis of Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategies for a multi-dimensional control system. 
It covers tracking setpoints and managing system dynamics under various constraints and operational conditions.

The project involves designing and tuning MPC controllers, ensuring constraint satisfaction, and analyzing their performance through closed-loop responses with linear and non-linear control.
